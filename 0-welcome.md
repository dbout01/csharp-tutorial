# C# Tutorial

Every beginning C# programmer should understand these basic topics:

* [Queues](1-queues.md)
* [Sets](2-sets.md)
* [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
